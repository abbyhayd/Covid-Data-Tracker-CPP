# Covid Data Tracker-CPP
 
## Project Background
I made this project while taking CPSC2430 (Data Structures) with Professor Xin Zhao at Seattle University. Created in CLionProject.

## Project Overview
This is a Binary Search Tree (basically a hash table) that has performs multiple operations, such as "insert", "search", "traverse", "height", etc. It was implemented through the use of recursion and linked lists. 

## Experience
This one of my first deep dives into using pointers, file operation, hash table operations, and collision resolving in C++. It also showed me how .h and .cpp files are used and how they relate to each other. It was a good lesson in C++ as someone who first learned to program in Java.
